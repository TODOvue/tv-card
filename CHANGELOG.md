## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-17

### Changed
- The library build now uses `src/entry.ts` (exports both the component and the plugin) instead of directly exporting the `.vue` file.
- CSS injection via JS has been removed for the library build (it is only kept for the demo), generating a `tv-card.css` file optimized for SSR/Nuxt.
- Changed node-version to workflows release.yml to 20.

### Added
- Plugin installation support: `app.use(TvLabel)` or `app.use(TvLabelPlugin)`.
- Explicit export of the style file: `import '@todovue/tv-label/style.css'`.
